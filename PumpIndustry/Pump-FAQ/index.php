            <p> Also called a pump performance curve; a pump curve is a graph that represents a pump's water flow capacity at any given resistance. The curve on a bar graph that shows the performance characteristics of a pump. Variables include size, flow rate and resistance.

The term head refers to the differential head developed by a pump expressed in feet of liquid:
                            <P>
                            <DD>H = [Pd-Ps] x 2.31 / SG
                                <P></P>
                      
            </DD>
                            <DD>where:
                                <P>H = pump head, FT of liquid Pd = pump discharge pressure, PSIG Ps = pump suction pressure, PSIG SG = liquid specific gravity Since a pump is not a perfect machine, losses mean that pump efficiency is an important factor in many applications. The required input power, called brake horsepower (BHP), is calculated from: BHP = [Q x H x SG] / [3960 x E] where E = pump efficiency expressed as a decimal fraction.
                                <P>The transmission of energy to the fluid can be accomplished in various ways. An impeller can be used as a rotating device which deflects liquid away from the center and converts kinetic energy into pressure energy. This group of "rotodynamic" pumps is the most common type and more commonly known as centrifugal pumps. With centrifugal pumps, the liquid is delivered in a continuous and uninterrupted flow.
                                <P>By exerting force on the liquid with a reciprocating unit, rotating piston, set of gears, peristaltic hose or equivalent means , a fluid can be forced to move. This class, known as positive displacement pumps, includes piston pumps, certain types of vain pumps with oscillating pistons, gear pumps, screw pumps and other rotary pumps.
                                <P>When a high velocity drive medium mixes with a lower velocity pumped medium, the drive medium imparts a proportion of its energy to the pumped liquid. This process is continuous and is employed by jet (also known as ejector) pumps.
                                <P>Airlifts use pressurized air or gas, which is introduced into a container of liquid with a lower specific weight, to move the fluid in a continuous manner.
                                <P>Hydraulic rams utilize shock energy to pump liquids by suddenly stopping a moving column of liquid which results in part of the column being pumped.
                                <P>Reciprocating pumps are characterized by high efficiency, often times as high as 90%. Yet these pumps operate at low speeds and are relatively large in size, leading to higher operating and capital costs. Centrifugal pumps generally have slightly lower efficiencies but maintain high speeds, smaller sizes and lower operating costs.</P>

Pumps can be used in various settings and to pump different types of liquids. Pumps can be used in the following applications:
      <OL>
        <LI>Residential - Small pumps serve many purposes in your home. Potable water may enter your house after being pumped from the well or through the municipal system. Your heating and/or cooling units use pumps to move fluids and air through those systems. High rise apartment buildings must maintain constant water pressure to ensure residents on the top floors receive the same pressure as those at street level.
            <P></P>
        </LI>
        <LI>Industrial - Fire pumps protect buildings and people during the work day. These systems stand primed and ready in case of fire. Pumps generate high water pressures for de-scaling and boiler feed applications. Some food and drink preparation requires pumps to insert the finished product into packaging.
            <P></P>
        </LI>
        <LI>Agricultural - Pumps support food production and agriculture by irrigating arid lands and areas with little rainfall. Wells and vertical pumps offer life supporting water to live stock as well as people.
            <P></P>
        </LI>
        <LI>Scientific and medical - Pumps are used in scientific arenas in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, toothpaste and medicine. Chemicals require special pumps, called process pumps, that seal the processed liquids from the outside environment preventing contamination. Blood and bodily fluids are moved with pumps and pumping systems when in surgical/medical settings.
            <P></P>
        </LI>
        <LI>Marine - Naval ships and other marine going vessels use pumps to de-water bilges, provide boiler feed, stabilize ballast systems, support weaponry and to turn sea water into potable water. Pumps are a very important component of a marine vessel&rsquo;s safety and security system.

            <p>A centrifugal pump is a kinetic energy type pump, versus a displacement pump. It imparts energy to a liquid by means of centrifugal force produced by a rotating unit, usually an impeller. Whereas, a displacement pump imparts energy using pistons, plungers, screws, vanes, or gears.
      <P>Centrifugal pumps are popular because of its design simplicity, high efficiency, wide range of capacity and head, smooth flow rate, low operating costs, varied sizes, and ease of operation and maintenance.

            <p> Viscosity is defined as the property of resistance to flow in a fluid. Viscosity of a fluid governs its flow. Changing the diameter of a pump impeller affects the flow, head and input brake horsepower of the pump in different proportions. Changing the impeller diameter affects the flow through the pump by a proportion equal to the increase or decrease in diameter. The pump head is changed by the square of the proportion of diameter change, while the brake horsepower is changed by the cube of the proportion of diameter change.
      <P>The viscosity of a fluid will determine the type of pump and configuration required. Viscosity is sometimes influenced by temperature. In general, the viscosity of a liquid changes as follows:
      <UL>
        <LI>as temperatures increase, viscosity decreases.
        <LI>as temperature decreases, viscosity increases.</LI>
      </UL>
      <P>The opposite is true for gases.
      <P>Compared with other liquids, water maintains unusual characteristics, in that it maintains both a low viscosity and a high viscosity index. Variations in viscosity are, therefore, seldom important in pump design, configuration and performance when pumping water. However, other, more viscous fluids can present challenges to pump designers and specifiers. You should contact your pump manufacturer for advice when you need to pump a viscous fluid.

            <p> Operation and maintenance requirements vary with the type of pump, the type of installation and the type of fluid being pumped. Operating and maintenance recommendations specified by the manufacturer should take precedence and should be implemented upon installation.
      <br>
      <br>
      A comprehensive and progressive record should be kept for each pump detailing components and procedures checked, preventative maintenance (PM) performed, maintenance intervals, operations and operational issues. A maintenance routine should be planned with the service conditions in mind rather than as an arbitrary routine or only when the pump malfunctions. A reduction of flow or performance can be determined fairly early by continuous monitoring of the pump and its records.

      <br>
      <br>
      Preventative routine maintenance extends the life of your pump and associated equipment. PM prevents unscheduled pump downtime while often times indicating more serious problems that will occur without the scheduled PM. Even though PM appears to add costs to pump operation in the short term, PM actually saves money through planned repairs and part replacements rather than extensive, costly and unexpected shut downs.

      <br>
      <br>
      Maintenance of the pump consists of periodically replacing the wearing parts such as sleeves, neck rings, packing material, lubricating mediums and others. Impellers and diffusers usually have a long life provided the pumped liquid is not corrosive or harmful. Damage may be caused by a combination of factors - corrosion, erosion, electrolytic action, graphitization and corrosion fatigue of the shaft.

Per the ANSI website: "the American National Standards Institute (www.ansi.org) has served in its capacity as administrator and coordinator of the United States private sector voluntary standardization system for more than 80 years. Founded in 1918 by five engineering societies and three government agencies, the Institute remains a private, nonprofit membership organization supported by a diverse constituency of private and public sector organizations. Throughout its history, the ANSI Federation has maintained as its primary goal the enhancement of global competitiveness of U.S. business and the American quality of life by promoting and facilitating voluntary consensus standards and conformity assessment systems and promoting their integrity. The Institute represents the interests of its nearly 1,000 company, organization, government agency, institutional and international members through its office in New York City, and its headquarters in Washington, D.C.<br>
<br>
ANSI does not itself develop American National Standards (ANS); rather it facilitates development by establishing consensus among qualified groups. The Institute ensures that its guiding principles -- consensus, due process and openness -- are followed by the more than 175 distinct entities currently accredited under one of the Federation's three methods of accreditation (organization, committee or canvass). In 1999 alone the number of American National Standards increased by nearly 5.5% to a new total of 14,650 approved ANS. ANSI-accredited developers are committed to supporting the development of national and, in many cases international standards, addressing the critical trends of technological innovation, marketplace globalization and regulatory reform."<br>

            <p>Priming is the addition of liquid into the pump casing which aides in the evacuation of captured air via a vent while creating a liquid seal inside the casing.
<br>
<br>
A self-priming pump develops a vacuum sufficient enough for atmospheric pressure to force the liquid to flow through the suction pipe into the pump casing without priming the pump. A self-priming centrifugal pump is especially designed with a large chamber at its discharge side that acts both as an air separator that removes the air from the liquid, and a reservoir that holds residual liquid used for priming or re-priming the pump. The pump has to be primed during the initial start-up but re-priming is done automatically without outside attention. Although self-priming appears to be a desirable feature for centrifugal pumps the trade-off is that pump efficiency is slightly compromised due to certain design constraints. This type of pump is popular with intermittent service such as drainage, sewage, and similar applications, but is less popular in continuous service applications where optimum efficiency is desirable and re-priming is seldom needed due to continuous operation.</p>

            <p>Specific speed is defined as the speed in revolutions per minute at which an impeller would operate if reduced proportionately in size so as to deliver a unit of capacity against a unit of total head. The performance of a pump can be determined by stating its speed, the head it generates and the rate of discharge. Yet, when comparing one pump to another, it is more useful to use one term which will provide a general description of the pump's performance characteristics.
<br>
<br>
Different types of impellers and flow patterns can best be compared by means of the specific speed. A pump can be classified as axial flow, mixed flow, or radial flow depending where the impeller discharges the liquid. An axial flow pump discharges the liquid in the axial direction compared to the pump shaft centerline, a radial flow pump discharges the liquid in the radial direction and a mixed flow pump is one that is a combination between a radial and an axial flow pump design.
<br>
<br>

Pumps have to be selected with the right specific speed impellers in order to operate satisfactorily in the desired application. High specific speed impellers (as fitted in axial flow and mixed flow pumps) are for high flow and lower head applications (such as ditch drainage, water supply operations, lift stations, flood control etc.) where huge amounts of water need to be moved quickly. Low specific speed impellers (such as those installed in radial flow pumps) produce higher heads (pressures) at moderate flow rates, typically this type of pump is used to move liquids to much higher elevation levels (e.g. water well pumps, process pumps, boiler feed pumps etc).</p>

            <p>Best Efficiency Point (BEP) is the point at which the impeller diameter provides the highest efficiency. BEP is an important parameter in that many parametric calculations are considered when calculating BEP, such as size, , specific speed, viscosity correction, and headrise to shut-off. Professional users prefer that pumps operate within 80% to 110% of BEP for optimum performance.
<br>
<br>
As you move away from the BEP, the shaft will deflect and the pump will experience some vibration. Check with the pump manufacturer to determine safe deviation levels from the BEP. Operating your pump away from BEP not only reduces efficiency but it will increase maintenance costs and may damage the pump. You can change the operating point by installing control valves, changing the impeller diameter, installing recirculation lines or selecting a different size of pump.
<br>
<br>

Sometimes "safety" factors can mean that the system is designed with a pump which is too large. Such a pump will operate to the left of the BEP as shown on the manufacturer's curve. Thus, the radial loads generated by the impeller and supported by the bearings will be greater (at BEP, most pumps are designed to generate no hydraulically generated radial loads). So when you are designing a system try not to use any safety factors, get as much information about the required flows and the "system curve" (the profile of the resistance of the system to increasing flows) to allow the pump maker to select exactly the right pump for your operation.</p>

            <p>Cavitation occurs when the pressure of the liquid in the suction line of the pump falls towards the "vapor pressure" (the pressure at which the liquid will turn from a liquid into a gas, or vaporize/boil). This occurs when the liquid is drawn into the "eye" of the pump impeller. If there is not enough suction head (head of liquid at the suction side of the pump) to allow the liquid to enter the pump without it falling to its vapor pressure, then vapor bubbles will appear. As the pump adds pressure energy to the fluid these bubbles rapidly and violently collapse back into a liquid state. These collapsing bubble carry a lot of energy and they can cause significant damage as they implode. This process of vapor bubble formation and implosion is called "cavitation".
<br>
<br>
Different fluids cavitate under different conditions of pressure and temperature and different pumps require different suction heads (known as "Net Positive Suction Head Required [NPSHr]) to operate without damaging cavitation.
<br>
<br>

Cavitation can accelerate the corrosion, pitting and erosion of pumps and pump parts, shortening the life of the pump. Prior to start up, priming will remove the air, ensuring that the available NPSH in the suction line is greater than that required by the pump (NPSHa > NPSHr).</p>
