            <p class="pp">   The Mackay Pump School is a program of pump reliability training dedicated
                                to the reduction of pump operating and maintenance costs. Our objective is to help
                                Operations and Maintenance Engineers and Technicians stop repetitive pump failure
                                and thus eliminate expensive and unscheduled pump downtime. This is achieved by
                                integrating the three vital areas of pump mechanics, system hydraulics and seal
                                operation, thus simplifying root cause analysis and developing effective troubleshooting
                                skills. In the last 15 years, over 20,000 have benefited from this learning experience
                                dedicated to the real problems of pumping.
